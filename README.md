Individual Project for Data Science Fundamentals for Fall 2023

  My chosen dataset is "best-selling-manga", it was obtainet from Kaggle.com. It was an interesting data for me, because this is a form of media that I read quite often. Obviously older long run manga series will gain a lot sales simply because they would have a lot more volumes than youger manga series, but they are also few and there are a lot pof ouliers of manga where it suddenly gained track and started selling a lot more. Because of the sudden gain of popularity for some new series I was curious if there were relation between genre/volume numbers and sales. If this, where I assumed as a sudden event, could actually be predicted. I chose this dataset because I want to learn how to do linear regression on Python and practice on it. It would be a nice dataset to familiarize myself with Python's linear regression.

| Variables | Description |
|:----: | :--- |
|Manga series | 187 Unique Titles. Ordered based on "Approximate sales in million(s)" variable. |
|Author | Who is/are the Author(s) of this manga series.|
|Publisher | This manga series is published under which publishing company.|
|Demographic | Who is the main target audiance of this manga series. |
|No. of collected volumes | How many volumes have been published on this manga series. |
|Serialized | How long was the run of this manga series. |
| Approximate sales in million(s) | Lowest at 20, Highest at 516.6. |
| Average sales per volume in million(s) | Lowest at 0.19, Highest at 10. |

Questions:
1. What is the most popular Author/Publisher/Demographic.
2. Assuming Number of Collected Volumes affects Sales what is the correlation between them.
3. Can we predict what would be the best selling Publisher.
